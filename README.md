# NextAuth Session Intermittently Undefined in API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug where the NextAuth session is intermittently undefined in an API route, even after successful login. This issue is infrequent and seems to be related to high server load or multiple simultaneous requests. 

## Bug Description

The API route uses `unstable_getServerSession` to obtain the user's session.  Under normal conditions, this works perfectly. However, under heavy load or with many concurrent requests, the session occasionally comes back as `undefined`, leading to unauthorized access errors.  The issue is not reproducible consistently which makes it difficult to debug.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4.  Simulate high load (e.g., using tools like k6) to trigger the bug. 
5. Observe the intermittent failures in API calls returning a 401 status code.

## Potential Causes

- **Race conditions:** A race condition during session retrieval, potentially due to asynchronous operations.
- **Caching issues:** A problem with Next.js's internal caching mechanism for sessions.
- **Server-side limitations:** The server might be unable to handle a high volume of requests effectively, leading to inconsistent results.

## Workaround (bugSolution.js)

While the root cause is unclear, adding retry logic can improve the reliability of session retrieval, as explained in `bugSolution.js`.
